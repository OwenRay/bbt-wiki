# Voice & Speech

This section covers all features related to voice control and speech recognition in the Baitboat Autopilot app.

Voice control allows you to operate your baitboat hands-free, using simple voice commands. This can be particularly useful when you're busy with other fishing tasks or when you need to make quick adjustments without taking your attention away from your fishing.
