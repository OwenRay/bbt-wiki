## What is a Baitboat?

A baitboat (also known as a bait boat) is a remote-controlled watercraft used by anglers to deliver fishing bait, hooks, and rigs to precise locations on the water that might be difficult to reach by casting. Modern baitboats often come equipped with GPS, fish finders, and other advanced technologies to enhance the fishing experience.
