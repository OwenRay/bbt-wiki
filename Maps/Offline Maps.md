## Downloading Offline Maps

### How to Download Region Maps

1. Go to the Settings tab (gear icon)
2. Tap on "Offline Maps"
3. Select "Region Maps"
4. Browse the list of available maps
5. Tap on the map you want to download
6. Wait for the download to complete

### How to Download Google Maps

1. Go to the Settings tab (gear icon)
2. Tap on "Offline Maps"
3. Select "Google Maps"
4. Navigate to the area you want to download
5. Tap the download button
6. Give your map area a name
7. Tap "Save" to start the download
   - A progress dialog will show you how many tiles have been downloaded
   - The app will return to the main screen when the download is complete

## Checking Download Progress

### For Region Maps

* You'll see a circular progress indicator showing how much of the map has been downloaded
* We recommend waiting until the download is complete before navigating away
* Once complete, an X will be shown which allows deletion of the map
* You can continue using the app while maps download

### For Google Maps

* A progress dialog shows the number of tiles downloaded and the total number of tiles
* You must keep the download screen open until the download completes
* You can view your downloaded areas by tapping the menu icon in the Google Maps download screen

## When to Use Which Map Type

### Use Region Maps When:

* You need detailed water information
* You have limited storage space on your device
* You're fishing in inland waters, lakes, or rivers
* You want faster map loading
* You don't want to worry about location and rather just want to download a whole country or province

### Use Google Maps When:

* You want to use satellite view to see actual photos of the area
* You're more familiar with Google Maps' appearance
* You know exactly where your water is located when you download the map

## Changing Map Order

The app can use both map types and will automatically choose which one to display based on your settings.

### How to Change Map Order:

1. Go to the Settings tab
2. Tap on "Offline Maps"
3. In front of each option you'll see a small handle
4. Drag the handle to change the order

### What Map Order Means:

* The first map in the order is tried first when displaying a location
* If the first map doesn't have data for that area, the second map is used
* Setting Region Maps first means the app will prefer to use them when available
* Setting Google Maps first means the app will prefer to use them when available

## Important Notes

### About Satellite View:

> **Important:** Satellite view is available only with Google Maps and is not currently supported for depth maps
> {: .warning}

### Tips for Best Performance:

* Download maps for your fishing areas before you leave home
* Keep both types of maps for important areas to ensure coverage
* Delete maps you no longer need to save storage space
* For depth information, use standard map view rather than satellite view
